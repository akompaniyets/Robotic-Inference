  * Nvidia DIGITS: classification and detection neural networks

_Project Description:_

This project was a second visit into the realm of deep neural networks. For this particular project, the Nvidia DIGITS interface was used for efficient neural network design and training. With the option of using AlexNet, GoogLeNet, or even a custom neural network architecture, the student was tasked with creating their own classification neural network. The chosen task for this project was in prediction of correct facial expression, specifically from a list of four possible emotions.

Data was collected individually, with image set expansion performed via image rotation and color inversion. Neural network training was done with AlexNet, GoogLeNet, as well as slightly modified AlexNet architecture.
     
   For a full report of how this was accomplished, as well as how the trained neural networks performed in classification, see the included write-up:
